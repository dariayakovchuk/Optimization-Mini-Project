Energy-Conserving Descent (ECD) for Optimization Project
====
This repository contains the code for the BBI optimizer, introduced in the paper _Born-Infeld (BI) for AI: Energy-Conserving Descent (ECD) for Optimization_. (http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11137). And aims to produce the experiments with the BBI optimizer.

- The BBI optimizer is implemented in the file `inflation.py` is based on https://github.com/gbdl/BBI by G. Bruno De Luca and Eva Silverstein, available under the license.
